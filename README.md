## Introduction:

I aim to develop a predictive model utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze key user data such as gender, age, number of dependents, loan amount requested, loan term length, credit history, income, and co-applicant income to empower lending institutions to make more informed and accurate decisions regarding loan approvals in an efficient manner. The goal is to create a classification model using these key attributes as inputs that can predict with high precision whether a given loan application should be approved or not. The model aims to improve loan approval accuracy and efficiency by using predictive analytics on key applicant data.

## Problem Statement:

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for home loans after that company validates the customer's eligibility for a loan. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer details provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer segments, that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.
